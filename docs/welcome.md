# Welcome to the Chaskiq plugin documentation

This documentation site is meant to provide guidance and information on creating and managing Chaskiq plugins. 
Chaskiq plugins are files located in the message_apis folder and are installed as AppPackages. These plugins enable you to extend the functionality of your Chaskiq application, and they can be developed locally or synced from the appstore.chaskiq.io.
